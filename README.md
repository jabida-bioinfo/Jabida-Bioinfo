# Jabida Sultana Mohammad 🧬

MSc Biotechnology  
Guntur, India   
**Quietly building bioinformatics tools, one small script at a time.**

### What I do
- Python for biology  
- Genetic disorders & gene regulation  
- PCR, microbial analysis, lac operon (my favorite from MSc)

### Little tools I made (growing slowly)
| Script                          | What it does                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| DNA Base Counter                | Counts A, T, G, C in any sequence      |
| Sickle Cell Mutation Checker    | Detects Glu → Val change in HBB gene   |
| Protein Translator              | DNA → Amino acid sequence              |
| Lac Operon Simulator            | Simple on/off logic with lactose       |

*(new ones appear whenever I learn something new)*

### Learning right now
- Biogrademy Python course (slow and steady)  
- Rosalind problems (a few every week)  
- GATE Biotechnology (daily reading)

### Skills (still growing)
Python • Biopython • Matplotlib • BLAST • Gene regulation • PCR
